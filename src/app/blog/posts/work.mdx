EYP Türkiye is inviting our Members to spend a weekend in Istanbul with us. The event is taking place from 8th to 9th March at the Istanbul IPA Habitat Şişli. Get ready for a time filled with excitement, learning and unforgettable memories! 



The 2nd Members Weekend of EYP Türkiye focuses on participation, sustainability, youth, and the environment. We will gather 12-15 NGOs across Türkiye to collaborate with our members to enhance their knowledge and abilities on sustainability and environmental law and law-making processes while also empowering their participation in youth engagement and civil society. We aim to achieve this goal through workshops, think tanks, working groups, and panels organised with the collaboration of NGOs.



This event will gather up 40-60 official members across Türkiye, including alumni, to also enrich our community with networking and experience sharing.
